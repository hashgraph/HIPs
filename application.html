<p>Application HIPs may be used to standardize software in the Hedera ecosystem that aren't mirror or consensus nodes. This includes application network software, external contract validators, multi-sig oracles, persistence mechanisms, enterprise software plugins, etc. An example of an Application HIP would be the Stablecoin Contract standard proposal and Non-fungible Token Contract written in Java as a layer-2 solution using the Hedera Consensus service to maintain trust.</p>

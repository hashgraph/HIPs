## Abstract

Describes the concept of how transactions can be issued by one account, but paid for by another account.

## Motivation

Oftentimes it is appropriate for the application to pay fees associated with a transation rather than the end user.

## Rationale

N/A

## User stories

As an end user that does not want to incur transaction fees on the network, I still want the ability to hold tokens on the Hedera network 
  
## Specification

```
//Java

Client client = Client.forTestnet();
client.setOperator(OPERATOR_ID, OPERATOR_KEY);

// Generate a new PrivateKey
PrivateKey userKey = PrivateKey.generate();

// Create the account with the userKey from above, set the balance to 5 HBAR,
// and capture the userId as a variable
AccountId userId = new AccountCreateTransaction()
        .setKey(userKey.getPublicKey())
        .setInitialBalance(new Hbar(5))
        .execute(client).getReceipt(client).accountId;

// Initiate a TransferTransaction with a debit of 1 HBAR from the new User's Account
// Sign the transaction with the OPERATOR_KEY (Fee paying account)
TransferTransaction transaction = new TransferTransaction()
        .addHbarTransfer(userId, new Hbar(-1))
        .addHbarTransfer(OPERATOR_ID, new Hbar(1))
        .freezeWith(client)
        .sign(OPERATOR_KEY);

// Convert the transaction to a byte array
byte[] transBytes = transaction.toBytes();

// Simulate the client the converting the transaction back to a type from a byte array
Transaction<?> transaction1 = Transaction.fromBytes(transBytes);

// send the transaction to the other user via rest API or other protocol for signing.
transaction1.sign(userKey);

// Create a different client
// The Client's key does not need to be set here since the transaction is already signed.
Client client2 = Client.forTestnet();

// Execute the signed transaction
TransactionResponse response = transaction1.execute(client2);
System.out.println("Getting receipt");

TransactionReceipt receipt = response.getReceipt(client2);
System.out.println("Transaction id " + receipt.status);
```

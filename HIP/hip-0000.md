## Abstract

Slight modifications were made to the original HIP-16.

## Motivation

The original HIP-16 mentions the auto renewal duration between ~81 days and ~92 days. The rationale was to provide  wider window for the auto renew duration period.

## Rationale

Refer to HIP-16

## User stories

Refer to HIP-16
  
## Specification

The minium auto renew period will be equal to ~30 days (2,592,000 seconds) and the max auto renew durtaion will remain equal to ~92 days (8,000,001 seconds).
  
## Backwards Compatibility
  
This feature is not enabled on mainnet and should therefore be backwards compatible. 

## Security Implications

N/A
  
## How to Teach This

Implementation of this feature will be referenced in release notes, supported by SDKs, as well as supported at docs.hedera.com.


## Reference Implementation
 
 The reference implementation change from the original HIP-16 is modifying ledger.autoRenewPeriod.minDuration from ~81 days to 30 days.

ledger.autoRenewPeriod.maxDuration=8000001 seconds // ~92 days ledger.autoRenewPeriod.minDuration=2592000 seconds // ~30 days

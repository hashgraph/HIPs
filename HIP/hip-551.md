## Abstract

This HIP defines a mechanism to execute batch transactions such that a series of transactions(HAPI calls) depending on each other can be rolled into one transaction that passes the ACID test (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability)

## Motivation

The existing implementation of transactions in the Hedera network does not allow multiple different HAPI transactions to be called in one single network transaction that would have all the ACID properties.
This makes it impossible to create more complicated flows without using smart contracts (which do not support all the HAPI transactions at this point) and listening to the mirror node to check the status of the previous transaction.
This way we can also achieve an abstraction away from smart contracts

## Rationale
Atomic transactions chain is from the protobuf point of view just a list of `SignedTransactions` that's, why we based our new protobuf message on it,
we only have to change the `bodyBytes` field to be `repeated`, that way we can store there multiple transaction bodies,
`SignatureMap sigMap` can stay unchanged because it's defined as `repeated SignaturePair sigPair`.

## User stories

1. As a Hedera token service user, I want to be able to unfreeze an account, send an NFT, and freeze it again in one ACID transaction, that way I can achieve an account-bound NFT(nontransferable NFT) collection, without using the hedera smart contract service.
We can use nontransferable NFTs e.g. as someoneâ€™s achievements, the creation of digital references, etc.

2. As a Hedera token service user, I want to be able to unfreeze an account, send an FT and freeze it again in one ACID transaction, that way I can achieve an account-bound FT(nontransferable FT) collection, without using the hedera smart contract service.
We can use nontransferable FT e.g. as game points, reputation points, etc.

3. As a Hedera token service user, I want to be able to wipe a token, mint a token, and transfer a token in one ACID transaction.
That way a backend developer could create complicated flows without the need to use smart contracts and the need to handle partially successful flows in the backend,
e.g. the wipe transaction was successful but the mint transaction was not.

4. As a Hedera service user, I want to be able to create batch transaction, that use multiple Hedera services e. g.
I want to be able to wipe a token, mint a token, transfer a token, and submit a topic message in one ACID transaction.
That way a backend developer could create complicated flows without the need to use smart contracts and the need to handle partially successful flows in the backend,
e.g. the wipe transaction was successful but the mint transaction was not.

5. As a Hedera token admin, I want to be able to gift Alice some tokens. I want to be able to mint and transfer the tokens in a single transaction.

6. As a Hedera token owner, I want to be able to wipe tokens from an account that I revoked the KYC. I want to be able to grant KYC, wipe tokens and revoke KYC in a single transaction.

## Specification
We could create a new protobuf message based on `SignedTransaction` message:
```
message BatchTransaction {
    /**
    * TransactionBodies serialized into bytes, which must be signed
    */
    repeated bytes bodyBytes = 1;

    /**
     * The signatures on the body with the new format, to authorize the transactions
     */
    SignatureMap sigMap = 2;
}
```
We could also create a predefined set of batch transactions and add new elements to it in the future
if the community asks for it.<br>
Initial set:
```
Unfreeze -> Transfer -> Freeze
Wipe -> Mint -> Transfer
Mint -> Unfreeze -> Transfer -> Freeze
Associate -> Mint -> Transfer
Associate -> Transfer
Mint -> Transfer
Grant KYC -> Wipe tokens from Alice account -> Revoke KYC
Transfer -> Topic Create -> Submit Topic Message
Transfer -> Submit Topic Message
Submit Topic Message -> Transfer
Associate -> Contract Call
Allowance Approval -> Contract Call 
Allowance Approval -> Allowance Approval -> Associate -> Contract Call
Allowance Approval -> Allowance Approval -> Account Update -> Contract Cal
Contract Call -> Contract Call
```
## Backwards Compatibility

## Security Implications
If we can consolidate approvals, associates, account updates, and contract calls into a single transaction, any reversion of contract calls at the end would automatically undo the approvals, associates, and account updates. This approach would enhance network security by minimizing dangling allowances and auto association slots.
## How to Teach This

## Reference Implementation

## Rejected Ideas
We rejected the idea to add the support of conditional branching to the batch transactions,
because we don't think it's useful compared to the increase of complications in implementing the HIP.

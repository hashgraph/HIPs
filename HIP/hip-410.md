## Abstract

Add a new transaction type that will hold signed Ethereum transactions and
execute them as Hedera transactions in a prescribed manner.

## Motivation

With [HIP-26 (Besu EVM)](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-26), the Hedera network
is EVM-compatible with Ethereum. This means the Hedera network accepts and
executes the same EVM bytecodes as any other Ethereum network. Transactions sent
to the Hedera network are Hedera transactions and use the Hedera API (HAPI). The
HAPI is based on gRPC and Google's protocol buffers (protobuf). Clients of
Hedera must use the HAPI for creating contracts and invoking contracts.

Standard Ethereum networks use JSON-RPC instead of gRPC, and they take Ethereum
transactions encoded as RLP rather than HAPI transactions encoded in protobuf.
The Ethereum ecosystem has a large and growing collection of tools and libraries
that is becoming a de facto standard development stack. These tools and
libraries work with RLP transactions only.

This HIP specifies a new HAPI transaction body that holds standard, Ethereum
encoded and signed transactions along with the specification for how to execute
those transactions. The program that prepares the Ethereum transaction, and
signs it, may be different from the program that submits that transaction to the
Hedera network. This would allow arbitrary Ethereum tools and libraries to
prepare and sign Ethereum transactions, and then using a small amount of code
the application could wrap those transactions and send them directly to the
Hedera network for execution, opening Hedera for more broad adoption by the
Ethereum development community.

## User Stories

### 1. As a web3 app I want to use web3.js and an Ethereum compatible wallet to create and sign transactions that execute in the Hedera network

I am a web3 developer, and I have created a web application that currently works
with Ethereum. In my application, I create transactions and send them to a
browser wallet such as Brave or Metamask for the user to sign. Using the Hedera
JS SDK, I am able to take that signed transaction and submit it to the Hedera
network for execution. Instead of web3.js, I might also use ethers.js.

### 2. As a web3 app I want to be able to pay transaction fees so my users can use zero-gas Ethereum transactions

I am a web3 developer, and I have created an application, however I do not want
my users to have to hold HBAR to use my application. I will have the dApp create
an Ethereum transaction with a zero gas price. My server receives that
transaction and wraps it in a Hedera transaction, and my server pays for all or
part of the Hedera fees needed for that transaction.

### 3. As a relay operator I want to be able to keep part of the transaction fees, so I can pay for infrastructure

I am a service provider, and I have opened up a public relay for Ethereum
transactions to be published into Hedera. I only accept transactions that have a
gas price that would be more than the total Hedera fees, and I transfer a
portion of that excess to my own accounts as a fee for services. Some
transactions are using the EIP1559 standard and limit how much of a fee I can
take as a relayer. I then use those fees to cover the costs of running my relay.

### 4. As a smart contract operator I want to be able to add authorizing signatures when transactions are relayed

I am a smart contract operator, and I have some transactions that require
multiple approvals in the same transaction. I want to operate a server that will
take an Ethereum transaction from a user, and then the relay server will decide
based on its own logic if I will approve the transaction and relay it with one
or more signatures. The keys for these signatures are only available to the
relay service and users have to use the relay service to get authorization from
those keys.

## Specification

This HIP proposes two new concepts: a transaction body
called `EthereumTransactionBody`
that simply wraps the RLP bytes, and a `relayer` that takes RLP bytes and wraps
them with an `EthereumTransactionBody` and sends them to Hedera. The `relayer`
can be the client app itself, or it can be any third party "bridge". Special
care is taken to account for payment of transaction submission separately from
payment of transaction execution to be consistent with the Hedera security
model.

The key that signs the Ethereum transaction must have a public key (ECDSA
secp256K1)
registered as an alias to an account on the Hedera network, and the `relayer`
must also have an account on the Hedera network.

![App as the Relayer](../assets/hip-410/flow-app-as-relayer.svg "App as the Relayer")

The above diagram provides a flow where the app itself is the relayer. In this
flow, the app creates the Ethereum transaction and sends it to Metamask or
another wallet for signing (1), retrieves those signed bytes (2), and using the
JS SDK creates a HAPI transaction in which the Ethereum transaction is wrapped
and sent to the Hedera network for execution. The user that signed the
transaction has an account on Hedera, and the application itself has an account
on Hedera.

![Bridge as the Relayer](../assets/hip-410/flow-bridge-as-relayer.svg "Bridge as the Relayer")

The above diagram proposes an alternative flow where the application itself does
not know about Hedera and the transaction is submitted by the wallet to the
relayer directly. The user that signs the transaction has an account on Hedera,
and the bridge has an account on Hedera, but the application itself does not.
The bridge may charge the application or client in various ways both in-band and
out-of-band, supporting a variety of economic models. The structure and form of
a relayer, and its relationship to any wallets or other software, is not
specified by this HIP.

### Protobuf changes

#### Ethereum Transaction

A new transaction body `EthereumTransactionBody` will be introduced to hold the
Ethereum transaction data.

```protobuf3
message EthereumTransactionBody {

    // required 
    bytes ethereumData = 1;

    // optional 
    FileID callData = 2; 

}
```

The Ethereum transaction data will be converted into a `ByteString`. If the
transaction is small enough it will be the entire unadjusted transaction.

To support larger transactions that won’t fit in a Hedera transaction due to
size limitations (such as contract create transactions) we will allow the `data`
section of the transaction (also referred to as callData or inputData) to be
stored as a Hedera file. In these instances the transaction body contains an
edited version of the Ethereum transaction, replacing a zero length string for
the `data` field in the RLP set in the `ethereumData` message field and storing
the call data in a Hedera File as a hex string. When the transaction is executed
and before the signatures are extracted the Ethereum transaction bytes will be
reconstituted to include the bytes from the reference file.

To support this transaction there will also need to be some changes in other
messages that would be customary for a new transaction body. The `ethereumNonce`
will also be reported in the `AccountInfo` message in the response to
`CrytpoGetInfoQuery`. The `ContractCallLocalQuery` will also get a `senderId` so
that the sender account of the view calls can be set. Similarly, the `senderId`
will be added to `ContractFunctionResults` recording the account that the
Ethereum signature resolved to.

```protobuf3
// basic_types.proto 
enum HederaFunctionality { 
    //... 
    EthereumTransaction = 84; // enum number may be different once finalized 
}

// smart_contract_service.proto 
service SmartContractService { 
    //... 
    rpc contractCallEthereum (Transaction) returns (TransactionResponse); 
}

// transaction_body.proto 
message TransactionBody { 
    //... 
    oneof data { 
        //...
        EthereumTransactionBody ethereumTransaction = 51; // field number may change
        //... 
    } 
    //... 
}

// transaction_record.proto
message TransactionRecord {
  //...
  bytes ethereum_hash = 19;
}

// crypto_get_info.proto
message CryptoGetInfoResponse {
    //...
    message AccountInfo {
        //...
        int64 ethereumNonce = 24;
    }
    //...
}

// contract_call_local.proto
//...
message ContractFunctionResult {
  //...
  AccountID senderID = 13;
}

//...
message ContractCallLocalQuery {
    //...
    AccountID senderID = 6;
}
```

#### ContractCreateTransaction

In the network today, contracts are first uploaded as files in the Hedera File
Service and then linked with the Smart Contract in a `ContractCreateTransaction`
. In the Ethereum ecosystem, the code for a smart contract is included in the
transaction itself.

In cases where the smart contract code is small, it may fit in a Hedera
Transaction. A new field, `initcode` will be added
to `ContractCreateTransactionBody`. Instead of uploading a file and then
supplying a `fileID`, you can instead supply the contract code directly in
the `ContractCreateTransaction`.

```protobuf3
message ContractCreateTransactionBody {
    oneof initcodeSource {
        FileID fileID =    1; 
        bytes initcode = 7; // field number may change in final draft 
    } 
    // ... 
}
```

### Value of gas price and value fields

For Ethereum transactions, we introduce the concept of “WeiBars”, which are 1 to
10^18th the value of a HBAR. This is to maximize compatibility with third party
tools that expect ether units to be operated on in fractions of 10^18, also
known as a Wei. Thus, 1 tinyBar is 10^10 weiBars or 10 gWei. When calculating
gas prices and transferred value the fractional parts below a tiny bar are
dropped when converted to tinyBars.

### Ethereum Requirements

The replay protection specified in EIP-155 will be required for legacy
transactions. The Type 1 / EIP-2930 and Type 2 / EIP-1559 transactions also
require a `chainId` field. Non-restricted `chainID`s (where `chainID` is less
than or equal to zero) are not supported.

For all transaction types the `chainID` specified must match the `chainID` of
the network as specified in [HIP-26](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-26)
(`0x127` for mainnet, `0x128` for testnet, `0x129` for devnet, and `0x12a` for
local networks).

### Transaction Signing Requirements

The sender of an Ethereum transaction body will be the account with an account
alias that is an ECDSA(secp256K1) public key. To identify the account the public
key will be recovered from the Ethereum transaction, and converted to an
Ethereum address. The transaction sender will then be set to the account whose
Ethereum address of the alias key has the same Ethereum address.

For the purposes of authentication signing the Ethereum transaction will provide
the same authorization as though the key signed the entire Hedera transaction.

### Paying for the Transaction

In addition to the account signing the Ethereum transaction (the sender account)
each Hedera transaction containing the Ethereum transaction will also need to be
signed by a Hedera account (the relayer account). These may be the same account
or different accounts.

If the relayer and sender account are the same account there are no limitations
on HBAR transfers.

When the relayer and sender account are different the following restrictions
apply to HBAR transfers. There are three components to consider, first is the
total amount of fees Hedera will charge the transaction. The second amount is
the amount fo fees the sender has validated to be spent, which is the `gasLimit`
of the transaction multiplied by either the `gasPrice` for Legacy and Type 1
transactions and the `max_fee_per_gas` field for type two transactions. This is
the sender authorized fees, and the total transaction amount charged to the
sender must be between the `value` authorized in the transaction and the `value`
plus the sender authorized fees. The third portion is either paid by or credited
to the relayer.

- When the Hedera charged fees matches the sender authorized fees then the
  sender will neither send nor receive HBAR. This is a rare case.
- When the Hedera charged fees exceeds the sender authorized fees then the
  relayer must make up the difference and will pay HBAR for the transaction.
- When the Hedera charged fees are less than the sender authorized fees, then
  some fees authorized by the sender may be received by the relayer such that
  the sender does not pay more HBAR than they authorized. The relayer may not
  need to receive all the excess HBAR, this depends on the transaction format
  that the transaction was sent in.
- For Legacy and Type 1 Ethereum transactions when the sender authorized fees
  exceeds the fees that Hedera charges then the relayer receives the HBAR beyond
  the Hedera fees. There is no mechanism for the relayer to receive less than
  the excess amount.
- For Type 2 Ethereum transactions the amount received by the relayer must not
  be greater than the `max_priority_fee_per_gas` multiplied by the `gasLimit`.
  This will often result in charging the sender less than the authorized amount.
  Note that the `gasLimit` is used instead of the calculated `gasUsed` to make
  relayer calculations easier. The relayer may receive less than the full amount
  of the priority fee if the total authorized amount does not provide enough
  HBAR.
- If there is `value` set to be transferred, then the entire amount must come
  from the sender. The relayer must not subsidise the transaction to the point
  it pays for value transfers.

Finally, if an Ethereum transaction reaches consensus and is invalid and cannot
be processed (for critical failures such as a bad ECDSA signature, an account
not matching the sender, an invalid Ethereum transaction, an incorrect nonce, or
any other such error) the relayer is responsible for all fees relating to
bringing the transaction to consensus.

### Account Nonce

Ethereum transactions have a different deconfliction and transaction enablement
mechanism than Hedera, but it is an inseparable part of Ethereum toolchains. To
that end we will support transaction sequence numbers as an additional
transaction validity check.

Each Hedera account will track a new value `ethereumNonce`, defaulting to zero.

When an `EthereumTransaction` is validated at consensus time the transaction
will fail if the account's `ethereumNonce` is not equal to the nonce in the
Ethereum transaction bytes.

If the transaction passes all validations and EVM execution (or equivalent
processing) starts then the `ethereumNonce` in the user account is incremented
by one. If the transaction fails for any reason prior to EVM execution the nonce
is not incremented.

### Executing the Transaction

Ethereum transactions can have a number of possible handling routes. All of them
are driven by the `to` field in the Ethereum transaction.

If the `to` field is empty, zero length, or all zeros, it will be converted into
a `ContractCreate` transaction. If the transaction has a `callData` value in the
transaction it will be placed in the `ContractCreate`s `fileID` field, otherwise
the data goes in the `initcodeBytes` field.

For non-zero non-empty `to` fields the address will first be decoded as a
standard solidity mapping (bytes 1-4 are shard, bytes 5-12 are realm, bytes
13-20 are id, big endian encoded). If this does not map to an exiting entity
then the `to` address will be processed as an alias, which currently can map to
Crypto Accounts and Smart Contract Accounts.

If the `to` field still does not map to an entity the transaction fails with a
Hedera error. Intrinsic gas will be charged to the sender account.

If the `to` address points to a Contract account the body of the Ethereum
transaction will be converted into a `ContractCall` and executed.

If the `to` address corresponds to a Token ID the call will initially be handled
as an EVM, and converted into a `ContractCall`. In future updates it will be
handled directly via the HTS Precompile code skipping the EVM step.

If the `to` address points to a Topic ID or File ID the call will be handled as
an EVM, and converted into a `ContractCall`. If precompile support for the
consensus and file service is developed then there may be similar handling as
token calls.

## Rationale

### Embedding Ethereum Transaction Directly

The signature in the Ethereum transaction is the most critical piece of data,
and must be validated on the exact bytes passed into the signing software.
Attempting to re-constitute the signed bytes or “vouch” for a signature (such as
custodial bridges) introduce categories of software that diminish the value of a
decentralized system.

### A Single Transaction Type

Adding Ethereum data to supported transactions adds more complexity to
transactions that need to track multiple modes. Similarly, a parallel series of
transactions increases the API surface in ways that will be hard to maintain.

### A Wrapped “Meta” Transaction

There are critical concepts in Hedera transaction processing, such as paying the
node that posted the transaction and transaction validity windows, that have no
equivalent in Ethereum and cannot easily be added to the transaction. Hence,
simply storing the “raw” Ethereum transaction would not provide enough
information to process the transaction.

By wrapping the Ethereum transaction in a Hedera transaction those values can be
added as appropriate to the Ethereum transaction at the discretion of the
transaction signer. Signing the transaction is also needed to seal in the
choices and ensure they are not mutable.

### Not Repeating Explicit and Implied Values

In order to save transaction space, no data that can be read directly from the
RLP (such as the nonce) or that is implied (such as the public key of the
signature) will be stored elsewhere in the Hedera transaction.

## Backwards Compatibility

This HIP introduces a new transaction type, and does not directly impact other
transactions. This HIP does increase the number of call paths that depend on
particular behavior of the smart contract and HTS precompile, however the impact
is expected to increase the fidelity and consistency of actions. Part of this
will be ensured by reusing all the transition logic from dependant transactions.

## Security Implications

The Ethereum transaction will change some validation logic for authorization of
actions. Instead of requiring signatures just at the Hedera transaction level,
the body of the Ethereum transaction will contain a signature that will
authorize actions within the scope of the transaction (value transfer and
contract/precompile calls). Security logic will need to be altered to also check
Ethereum transaction data for authorization. Because security logic in Hedera is
to Deny by default, any implementation errors will be expected to prevent
legitimate actions but not enable illegitimate actions.

## How to Teach This

This is not a transaction dApps and integration software will typically use
unless they specifically need Ethereum style transactions. Typical apps using
this would be apps bridging JSON-RPC calls or apps integrating with other
Ethereum tooling as a downstream consumer.

The documentation for this transaction should emphasize that normal HAPI APIs
provide greater control and functionality than the functionality exposed via
Ethereum transactions. If the application has control over the key signing
functionality, this transaction should be avoided.

## Reference Implementation

An incomplete prototype implementation is
at [https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/tree/rlp](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/tree/rlp)
. A production version will follow.

## Rejected Ideas

### Foreign Transaction Data

An internal prototype piloted the idea of adding foreign transaction data to all
possible transactions, and then populating a normal Hedera transaction with the
data from the foreign bytes. Transition logic would need to be updated to either
validate the data matches the foreign bytes or to reject any transaction with
foreign data.

This was rejected because it introduced a large amount of data duplication.
Parsing of RLP data is very quick in comparison to other cryptographic
validations and the weight on the record stream was deemed too much.

### Enhanced Transaction Types

An idea that was work-shopped was to create separate 'Ethereum' variants of each
of the transaction types, populating each with the Ethereum transaction and
doing similar field copying semantics.

This idea was rejected because the explosion in number of transaction types was
deemed a risk to software maintenance.

### Storing just the Ethereum Transaction

There was brief discussion on the idea of storing the Ethereum transaction
without any Hedera wrappers, and having the transaction execution logic detect
the transaction and handle it directly.

This was rejected because of the inability to deconflict and deduplicate
transactions in the manner that is required for the Hedera network structure.
The node also was unable to be identified for proper credit in bringing the
transaction to consensus.

## Open Issues

### Nonce Management

Using Ethereum nonces introduces the nonce management issue for clients wishing
to use Ethereum Transactions. Most ecosystem tools already have nonce management
built in using JSON-RPC APIs. JSON-RPC Bridges and other tools utilizing this
feature will need to keep a few considerations in mind.

First, Hedera has no memory pool. The notion of cancelling transactions out of
the memory pool with a higher priced transaction of the same nonce won't work.
Once submitted to a node and accepted by that node the transaction will be
executed and cannot be cancelled. Fast finality helps alleviate this problem as
a whole.

Nonces only increase and never go up. Thus, when relayers are presented with a
transaction that has a nonce that is lower than the accounts current nonce
should always reject that transaction and not relay it.

Gaps in nonce are not accepted. If a transaction comes to consensus with a nonce
greater than the expected nonce it will fail execution. The Ethereum transaction
may be resubmitted in the future when the nonce in the transaction is the same
as the nonce expected by the account.

### Fee Payments User Experience

Because the fee mechanisms between Ethereum and Hedera are not identical there
will be some friction between existing ecosystem tools and Hedera.

For an end user it is recommended to use the tool in a fashion that will produce
Type 2 Ethereum Transactions, as specified in EIP-1559. In these transactions a
higher than expected max fee per gas be set while setting a more reasonable max
priority fee per gas. With this configuration the actual fees will be more in
line with a regular Hedera transaction and a small fee paid to the relayer for
the work of wrapping the transaction and presenting it to the node.

Transaction sent in the Legacy and Type 1 formats will pay all excess fees to
the relayer. There is no mechanism to accept less. This can produce awkward
situations where the gasprice is accidentally set to a very large value. Using
type 2 transactions reduces this risk and is why they are the recommended
ethereum transaction format.

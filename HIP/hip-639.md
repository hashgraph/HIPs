## Abstract

A bug in the consensus nodes can cause them to export bad data in the record stream, so we need a way 
to issue errata records. In this HIP we propose a superuser-only `issueRecordStreamErrata` RPC to 
publish corrections to the record stream, including "compensating" actions that mirror nodes can take 
to bring their databases back in sync with the consensus node state. 

We do **NOT** propose any way for superuser accounts to change the consensus node state.

## Motivation

Although it should be extremely rare, it will remain possible for bugs to cause consensus nodes to 
export bad data in the record stream. If this happens, we need a precise, highly visible way to issue
an errata for mirror nodes. The errata should be signed by a super-majority of consensus nodes.

## Rationale

The two main decision points in the design are:
  1. Whether to support "decorating" the record stream with errata sidecars _at the time errors occurred_.
  2. How to instruct mirror nodes to "compensate" for the side effects of an error.

### Errata sidecars

The benefit of errata sidecars is that if a mirror node syncs from a database snapshot before the error, 
it can avoid the error entirely, and simply use the correct record based on the sidecar. But mirror node 
sync times are sufficiently long that there is no practical reason to ever start a sync from any but the 
latest snapshot.  This means there is no practical benefit to decorating the stream with an errata at some 
time in the distant past, since no syncing node will ever "be there" to appreciate it. (It is also unclear 
how a syncing node would be able to validate signatures on an errata sidecar, since the signatures could 
come from keys in a future address book that the syncing node knows nothing about.) Therefore we chose not 
to support errata sidecars.

### Compensating actions

There are many techniques we could use to instruct mirror nodes to correct their databases at the consensus 
time of the `RecordStreamErrataTransactionBody`. The ideal technique would have the expressiveness of 
ANSI SQL. But mirror nodes are free to use any form of database and schema they like, so some mirror node 
developers might face great difficulty in supporting a SQL-like language that assumes a different schema.
We chose to use synthetic transactions to define compensating actions because mirror nodes must already
support transactions. The weakness of this choice is that we can imagine a bug whose side effects cannot
be "fixed" by any sequence of synthetic transactions. If such a bug occurred, we would be forced to add
a more general compensating strategy to the `RecordStreamErrataTransactionBody`.

## User stories

- As a network operator, I want to publish a precise, maximally visible errata to the record stream after 
a bug in the consensus nodes has caused an error.
- As a mirror node operator, I want a trustworthy source of record stream errata that will automatically
bring my mirror node database back in sync with consensus node state.
  
## Specification

We propose a new `TransactionBody` type,
```
message RecordStreamErrataTransactionBody {
    // The (past) consensus time at which an export error occurred
    Timestamp consensus_time_of_error = 1;

    // The data that should have been exported (unset if no data should have 
    // been exported); allows mirror nodes to fix transaction history tables
    RecordStreamItem correct_item = 2;

    // One or more synthetic transactions whose side effects, when incorporated
    // in the mirror node database in the normal way, will bring its present state
    // back in alignment with the consensus node state; these items must NOT
    // be inserted in any transaction history tables
    repeated RecordStreamItem compensating_items = 3;
}
```

We suggest this transaction type be submitted using a `NetworkService` RPC  named 
`issueRecordStreamErrata`; and that it require a superuser payer account number (either 
`2` or `50`). 


## Backwards Compatibility

There is no existing errata feature to maintain backward compatibility with.

## Security Implications

It would be very bad  if an unauthorized account was able to issue record stream errata. 
Even when the network limits this ability to superusers, there is a material risk 
of human error in constructing the `RecordStreamErrataTransactionBody`. This risk should 
be acceptable, however, since if operators issue an incorrect errata for time `T1` at 
time `T2`, they can correct that mistake at `T3` by issuing _another_ errata for time 
`T1` whose `compensating_items` at `T3` take into account the effects of the 
`compensating_items` applied at `T2`.

## How to Teach This


## Reference Implementation

TBD

## Rejected Ideas

As noted in the Rationale section, we considered but did not propose:
  1. Inserting an errata side car into the stream at the consensus time of an error.
  2. Defining a general way to specify mirror nodes database changes.

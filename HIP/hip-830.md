## Abstract

This HIP proposes several changes to the event serialization format.

1. Add the `rosterRound` to the metadata of new events. The `rosterRound` is the latest round to
   come to consensus on the node that created the event and is used to look up the correct consensus
   roster for validating the event's signature on other nodes.
2. Represent references to an event as `EventDescriptors`. EventDescriptors are used by an event to link to its
   self-parent and other parents.
3. Allow for multiple other parents.
4. Reduce an event's unhashed metadata to just the event's signature.

## Motivation

### Add `rosterRound` to Event Metadata

When we allow dynamic address books such that nodes can be added or removed from the consensus roster without restart,
we need a way to indicate which consensus roster was active when an event was created. A new consensus roster becomes
active on a round boundary. Writing the `rosterRound` into an event's metadata will provide a way to look up the
effective consensus roster to validate the event's signature.

This round number will also be used to determine when an event has become ancient and is no longer able to come to
consensus if it has not reached consensus yet.

### EventDescriptors as Event References

An EventDescriptor is a 4-tuple:

1. `eventHash` - The hash of the event.
2. `creatorId` - The NodeId of the node that created the event.
3. `generation` - The generation of the event. (1 + the max of the event's parents' generations)
4. `rosterRound` - The latest round to reach consensus on the node when the event was created.

The EventDescriptor is the minimal amount of information needed to identify an event by its hash, which node created
it, and be able to determine when an event has become ancient. It is used in place of the event itself when the
payload of the event (the transactions) are not needed. This encapsulation of metadata will allow us to further
improve gossip, validation, and consensus algorithms.

### Multiple Other Parents

An event's ability to come to consensus is based on whether witness events can strongly see the
event through parent links. Allowing for multiple other parents will improve the ability of events to be
strongly seen by witnessing events. This is expected to reduce the number of rounds needed for an event to come to
consensus.

While this change at the event serialization level will take effect in the software version under development when the 
Pull Request merges, the gossip and consensus algorithms will remain unchanged at this time. Events will continue to 
have a single other parent until new algorithms and a new implementation have been developed.

### Signature As Unhashed Metadata

All event data that is used in consensus must be hashed and signed to validate that the event has not been tampered
with. After the above changes have been added to the collection of hashed data, the only remaining piece of data
that is unhashed is the signature, which cannot be hashed.  Going forward, the implementation will no longer 
encapsulate unhashed metadata as an object. 

## Rationale

This proposal comes from the Swirlds Labs Platform Hashgraph Team which maintains the algorithms and implementation
used for gossiping events and determining consensus. We have bundled these serialization changes together to
minimize the number of times we change the serialization format.

## User stories

Jane is a node operator and pays a per byte data rate for her internet usage. Improved gossip algorithms will reduce
data duplication during node communication and save Jane money.

John is a retail vendor with customer payments over the Hedera network. The time an event takes to come to
consensus is part of the payment processing experience of his customers. A shorter consensus time translates to improved
customer experience.

Jill is retiring her node from the network. Jack is starting a new node in the network. Both want their nodes to
transition into (in)activity outside of network maintenance windows. The ability to dynamically change the active
nodes participating in consensus while keeping the network secure and performant requires the ability to identify
which address book an event is related to when it is created.

## Specification

The following specification describes the bytes on the wire for an event and its contained objects. The data
structures are described in order of their composite nesting, leaves of the tree first. Serialization formats which
have not changed may be omitted.

## Backwards Compatibility

This event serialization change is included in v0.45 of the implementation of the platform. The implementation of
v0.45 will support deserialization of the event format used in v0.44 and will re-serialize the events in the older
serialization scheme for the purpose of checking the signature on the events. All new events created by v0.45 will
be in the new serialization scheme. After v0.45 is delivered, the older serialization scheme may not be supported
in future releases.

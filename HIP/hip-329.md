## Abstract

[EIP-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014) introduced the `CREATE2` opcode to let a 
contract be deployed to a predictable address on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Because each Hedera entity must have a unique `0.0.X` id, and the Solidity address of a 
Hedera contract is currently _determined_ by its `0.0.X` id, there has not, historically, 
been a natural way to implement `CREATE2` on our ledger.

But after [HIP-32](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-32), there is now a mechanism in the code 
that provides a level of indirection between a `ByteString` "alias" and a `0.0.X` id. We propose
in this HIP to implement `CREATE2` by re-using the alias mechanism to link the deterministic 
address specified in EIP-1014 to a new contract's `0.0.X` id.

To externalize this `0.0.X`-to-address link to mirror nodes in the record stream, we propose to 
re-use the "internal" transaction records introduced in [HIP-206](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-206),
only adding a new `bytes solidity_address` field to the record. To simplify client calls to 
contracts created via `CREATE2`, we propose to extend the `ContractCallTransactionBody` with an 
option to specify a `ByteString solidity_address`, instead of the `ContractID contractID`.

## Motivation

Standard implementations of a distributed exchange (DEX), for example, make heavy use of 
the `CREATE2` opcode. This opcode can also improve user onboarding flows in dApps. We want 
to let such applications to be deployed on Hedera.

## Rationale

The business value of this HIP is self-evident, so the only decision points are in the changes
to Services code and protobuf messages. Our reasoning is that:
  1. Re-use of the alias mechanism reduces risk and complexity in the codebase.
  2. Externalizing created `0.0.X`-to-address links via a new `solidity_address` field in the 
     record follows the same pattern used in auto-account creation.
  3. Although the `GetBySolidityIDQuery` _can_ be used to look up the `ContractID` for any 
     Solidity address, this is not a free query and clients may prefer to pre-compute the 
     `CREATE2` address and use it directly.

## User stories

- As a Hedera DEX operator, I want to re-use standard Solidity contracts that use the `CREATE2` opcode.

## Specification

- Implement the `CREATE2` EVM opcode `0xF5` in Services by linking the EIP-1014 address to the new 
  contract's underlying `0.0.X` id as an alias, and updating the EVM address lookup to be alias-aware. 
- Externalize this address-to-`0.0.X` link to mirror nodes via new `ContractCreate` child records.
- Update HAPI to include a new `bytes solidity_address` field in the `TransactionRecord` message,
to be populated in these child transactions. 
- Similarly, add a new `bytes solidity_address` field in the `ContractCallTransactionBody` and 
`ContractCallLocalQuery` so that users can directly call a contract by its `CREATE2` address.
- Deprecate the `createdContractIDs` field in the `ContractFunctionResult` message, since this 
information will now be duplicated by the new child transactions.

## Backwards Compatibility

No existing contract should be affected by this HIP---unless it was failing due to use of 
`CREATE2`, in which case it will become functional!

## Security Implications

The Ethereum community and others have now demonstrated patterns that allow safe use of `CREATE2`.
As long as users follow the patterns in these contracts, there should not be security implications.

## How to Teach This

"Implement EIP-1014 on Hedera to allow creating contracts at pre-determined addresses."

## Reference Implementation

The user-facing changes to HAPI have been discussed in [this PR](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs/pull/138).

## Rejected Ideas

In principle, it may be possible to make `CREATE2` addresses globally unique across all shards. 
But the extreme complexity of this task did not seem justified by the value provided.

## Open Issues

No blocking issues are known at this time.

## Abstract

This HIP proposes enhancing the Supply Key functionality within the Hedera ecosystem, specifically enabling the Supply Key to update an NFT metadata field while the NFT is held in the treasury wallet. This ensures secure and controlled adaptability of NFTs, meeting dynamic needs while maintaining their integrity post-distribution.

## Motivation

Currently, there is a limitation in dynamically updating NFTs in a controlled manner. The proposed enhancement to the Supply Key functionality addresses this gap, allowing for secure and selective updates of NFTs within the treasury wallet, a feature particularly relevant for various evolving use cases in the Hedera ecosystem.

## Rationale

The enhancement focuses on granting the Supply Key the capability to update the data of an NFT serial number exclusively while it is in the treasury wallet. This approach ensures security and control, preventing unauthorized modifications once the NFT is distributed.

## User Stories

- As a game developer, I want to update game piece NFTs with player stats during gameplay, ensuring the data becomes immutable once the player regains ownership.
- As an event organizer, I need to update event ticket NFTs with attendee information while they are in the treasury wallet, guaranteeing data immutability post-transfer.

## Specification

This HIP requires an update to the Supply Key mechanism, enabling it to modify the metadata of NFTs while they are held in the treasury wallet. The NFT data should remain immutable once distributed, ensuring integrity and trust in the NFT ecosystem.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal introduces no backward incompatibilities within the current Hedera ecosystem.

## Security Implications

The primary security consideration is the prevention of unauthorized data modifications to NFTs post-distribution. The treasury wallet requirement for updates addresses this concern effectively. 

There is no added security concern with the ability of Supply Key to adapt the metadata when in the treasury wallet as the Supply Key can also burn and mint new tokens. The security implications of sending a NFT to a treasury wallet that has a Supply Key enabled does not become worse or better with this HIP.

## How to Teach This

Educational initiatives will be developed to guide users in leveraging the new Supply Key functionality, particularly focusing on use cases like gaming and event management.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation will be comprehensive, including detailed documentation and test cases. Completion is expected prior to the HIP achieving "Final" status.

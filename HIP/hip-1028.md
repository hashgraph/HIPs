## Abstract

HIP-646/657/765 introduces a new metadata field for Fungible Tokens (FT), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) and METADATA key  
for updating metadata. However, these features are not supported by smart contracts.  
This proposal aims to enhance Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS) by exposing HIP-646/657/765 features.

## Motivation

A user may need to create, update and get info for Fungible Tokens (FT), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) and METADATA key through contract.  
The current version of Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS) does not cover these use cases.

## Rationale

The HSCS already has the functionality to create and update tokens, so we would want to extend these.  

However, we will add new functions for getting info for tokens to not break the older version of ``HederaTokenService.sol``  

New function  for TokenUpdateNfts HAPI operation will be added  

## User stories

1. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that creates a fungible token with metadata.
2. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that creates a non-fungible token collection with metadata.
3. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that updates a fungible token with metadata.
4. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that updates a non-fungible token collection with metadata.
5. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that creates a fungible token with a metadata key.
6. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that creates a non-fungible token collection with metadata key.
7. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that updates a fungible token with metadata key.
8. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that updates a non-fungible token collection with metadata key.
9. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that creates a fungible token with metadata and metadata key.
10. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that creates a non-fungible token collection with metadata and metadata key.
11. As an EOA I would like to initiate a smart contract transaction that updates the metadata of NFT(s).

## Specification

We will utilize the existing Hedera Token Service (HTS) HAPI transactions.  
To achieve this the Hedera Token Service (HTS) system contract must be updated to expose the necessary features.  
Existing system contract functions must be extended and new functions must be added to the `IHederaTokenService` interface  
to support the metadata field and key.

### System contract extension

The `IHederaTokenService.sol` is further extended with new types and function signatures that the system contract will respond to.

### New Solidity Types

The following structs have been added to support metadata and metadata key

```solidity
struct HederaTokenV2 {
    String name;
    String symbol;
    // other fields are like in HederaToken
    ...
    // The new field for metadata
    bytes metadata;
}
```

```solidity
struct TokenInfoV2 {
    // The new struct with metadata
    HederaTokenV2 token;
    // other fields are like in TokenInfo
    ...
}
```

```solidity
struct FungibleTokenInfoV2 {
    // The new struct with metadata
    TokenInfoV2 token;
    int32 decimals;
}
```

```solidity
struct NonFungibleTokenInfoV2 {
    // The new struct with metadata
    TokenInfoV2 token;
    // other fields are like in NonFungibleTokenInfo
    ...
}
```
Adding comment to TokenKey struct to clarify the 7th bit is for metadata key

```solidity
struct TokenKey {
    // bit field representing the key type. Keys of all types that have corresponding bits set to 1
    // will be created for the token.
    // 0th bit: adminKey
    // 1st bit: kycKey
    // 2nd bit: freezeKey
    // 3rd bit: wipeKey
    // 4th bit: supplyKey
    // 5th bit: feeScheduleKey
    // 6th bit: pauseKey
    
    // the 7th bit will be metadata key
    // 7th bit: metadataKey
    uint keyType;
    
    // the value that will be set to the key type
    KeyValue key
}
```

### Solidity Function Signatures

The new structs will change the signature of the functions. However the old versions of the functions will continue working.

## Backwards Compatibility
Backward compatibility is ensured by adding new functions where needed.

## Security Implications

The HIP provides exposure to existing HTS functionality. Fundamentally security is still governed by the ledger security logic  
in combination with the EVM. As such, there should be no security implications.

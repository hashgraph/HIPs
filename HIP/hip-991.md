## **Abstract**

This document outlines the development of a fixed fee system for the submission of topic messages on the Hedera network. It addresses the need for improved economic scalability and aims to enhance resource allocation and revenue distribution mechanisms for topic operators. It also seeks to simplify engineering complexity for dApp developers on the Hedera network.

## **Background and Motivation**

**Problems to Solve:**

* **Dynamic Restriction of Access to Topic Writing:** Users currently face difficulties when creating new topic IDs because they must choose between making the topic publicly writable for a very low cost or implementing a complex web architecture to manage access through the submit key. This complexity can hinder user experience and development efficiency.
* **Ease of Monetization:** Developers and businesses find it challenging to charge users for submitting information to a topic due to the lack of a native fee structure. A built-in payment system would streamline monetization, allowing developers to easily charge for topic submissions, which can enhance the financial viability of their applications.
* **Resource Allocation:** The current low fee of $0.0001 per message makes it difficult for topic operators to manage and predict the economic impact of high-traffic topics. Users can suffer from spam and unexpected messages that operators have to handle, potentially degrading the quality of service.
* **Token and HBAR Utilization:** There is an opportunity to expand the utility of various tokens within the Hedera ecosystem. By allowing fees to be paid in tokens other than HBAR, such as those required by DAOs, users can leverage their token holdings for topic submissions, enhancing the ecosystem's flexibility and user engagement.

---

**Feature Summary:**

* Introduces an optional fee for submitting messages to a topic. When fixed fees are enabled, HBAR or FT payments are required for message submissions, with exemptions for holders of a submit key. Submit keys are not required for topics with fees.
* Introduces a Fee Schedule Key for topic creation. This key can set the fee for message submissions, with exemptions for holders of a submit key.
* Fees can be distributed similarly to fixed fees on the HTS, supporting multiple wallets, percentage distributions, and Fungible token in addition to HBAR.
* Cannot add Key after creation - similar to tokens.

**Benefits:**

* Provides predictable revenue per message for topic operators.
* Enables new products and business models on HCS.
* Increases node revenue for network fees tied to new HCS transactions/topic creations with fixed fees.
* Enhances the utility of HCS within Hedera.
* Increases revenue streams for node operators.
* Enables simple facilitation of holding and spending tokens to document new information on a topic.

**Related Requests:** This enhancement is in response to community feedback (Tier Bot) requesting more versatile and predictable economic models within topic IDs on the Hedera network.

## **Specification**

### **Conceptual Overview**

We propose adding a fixed fee mechanism to the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for topic messages, similar to the custom fee structures in the Hedera Token Service (HTS). This will involve creating new Protobuf messages and modifying existing ones to accommodate fixed fees for topics.

### **Protobuf Messages Needed**

### **FixedFee**

The `FixedFee` message represents a fixed fee charged for each message submission to a topic. This protobuf message already exists so it can be re-used.

```
message FixedFee {
  // The number of units to assess as a fee
  int64 amount = 1;
  // The denomination of the fee; taken as hbar if left unset
  TokenID denominating_token_id = 2;
}
```

### **CustomFixedFee**

The `CustomFixedFee` message defines the type of fee and the account receiving the fee assessed during a message submission to the associated topic. A custom fee may only be fixed and must specify a fee collector account to receive the assessed fees.

```
message CustomFixedFee {
  // Fixed fee to be charged
  FixedFee fixed_fee = 1;

  // The account to receive the custom fee
  AccountID fee_collector_account_id = 3;
}
```

### **Modified Protobuf Messages**

### **TopicCreateTransactionBody**

The `TopicCreateTransactionBody` message is updated to include an optional `custom_fees` property for specifying fixed fees during topic creation.

```
message TopicCreateTransactionBody {
  // The ID of the topic to be created
  TopicID topic_id = 1;
  // The custom fees to be assessed during a message submission to this topic
  repeated CustomFee custom_fees = 2;
}
```

### **TopicInfo**

The `TopicInfo` message is updated to include the current list of custom fixed fees associated with the topic.

```
message TopicInfo {
  // The ID of the topic
  TopicID topic_id = 1;
  // The custom fees to be assessed during a message submission to this topic
  repeated CustomFee custom_fees = 2;
}
```

### **TransactionRecord**

The `TransactionRecord` message is updated to include the list of custom fees assessed as part of executing the transaction represented by this record. This protobuf message already exists so it can be re-used.

```
message TransactionRecord {
  // All custom fees that were assessed during a message submission
  repeated AssessedCustomFee assessed_custom_fees = 13;
}
```

### **New gRPC Service Methods**

### **TopicService**

Updates to the `TopicService` to include methods for creating topics with custom fees and updating the fee schedule for a given topic.

```
service TopicService {
  // Creates a new topic with optional custom fees
  rpc createTopic (Transaction) returns (TransactionResponse);
  // Updates the custom fee schedule for a topic
  rpc updateTopicFeeSchedule (Transaction) returns (TransactionResponse);
}
```

### **Example Implementations**

Below is an example of creating a topic with a fixed fee.

```
const { Client, TopicCreateTransaction, CustomFee, CustomFixedFee, Hbar, AccountId, TokenId, PrivateKey } = require("@hashgraph/sdk");

// Create the Hedera client
const client = Client.forTestnet();

// Define the submit key
const submitKey = PrivateKey.generate();

// Define the fee collector account ID
const feeCollectorAccountId = AccountId.fromString("0.0.12345");

// Define the fixed fee
const customFee = new CustomFixedFee()
    .setAmount(100)
    .setDenominatingTokenId(TokenId.fromString("0.0.56789")); // Optional, HBAR if unset

// Create the topic with the custom fee
const transaction = await new TopicCreateTransaction()
    .setTopicMemo("Example Topic with Fixed Fee")
    .setSubmitKey(submitKey)
    .setCustomFees([customFee])
    .execute(client);

console.log(`Created topic with ID: ${transaction.topicId}`);
```

This implementation shows the creation of a topic where each message submission requires a fixed fee of 100 HBAR, collected by the specified account.

### **Backwards Compatibility**

There are no known backwards compatibility issues. Existing topics without custom fees will continue to function as they currently do. New topics with custom fees will require appropriate updates to the Hedera SDKs, mirror nodes, and applications to support the new fee structures.


### **Security Implications**

The introduction of custom fees adds an additional layer of economic control but also introduces potential vectors for abuse, such as fee manipulation.

**User Personas and Stories**

**User Personas:**

* **Topic Operator:** Entities or individuals who manage and operate topics, interested in stable revenue and easy management of topic-related transactions.
* **Topic Operator:** Entities or individuals who manage and operate topics, interested in reducing the noise of public topic IDs/making it more difficult to spam an open topic.
* **Regular User:** End users who interact with topics, adding paid methods of interaction and submission to topics.

**User Stories:**

* As a **Topic Operator**, I want to set a fixed fee for submitting messages to my topic, so that I can ensure a consistent revenue stream and manage my topic effectively.
* As a **Regular User**, I want to know the exact cost of interacting with a topic.


## **Requirements and Scope**

* Implementation of an optional custom fee key on a topic ID during topic creation.
* Requirement for users to submit HBAR equivalent to the fee for message submissions.
* Exemption from fees for users with a submit key (if a submit key is also present on the topic).
* Distribution of collected fees akin to fixed fees on tokens, with support for distribution to multiple wallets, specified percentages.
* Exploration of using fungible tokens in addition to HBAR for fee payments.
* Ensuring compatibility and integration with existing Hedera network protocols and services.


## **User Flows and Interaction**

* Users will specify the fee settings during the topic creation process through a simple interface in their Hedera client (refer to the creation of token custom fees/fixed fee for reference).
* On submitting a message to a topic through a application or wallet interface, users will see the required fee and have the option to proceed or cancel.
* Operators will get fee collections and distributions automatically through the custom fees just like they do in the token service currently.


## **Data Sharing, Privacy, and Security**

* Adherence to Hedera’s existing data privacy standards, ensuring that user identities and transaction details remain protected.
* Implementation of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to fee configurations and distributions.
* Callout on the HIP that when programmatically connecting to topics that have a custom fee key enabled, to set max fee on transactions so that if the fee is changed to be higher per message submission, the user isn’t charged more.

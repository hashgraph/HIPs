## Abstract

This specification provides a standard scheme for fungible token metadata on HTS. The intent is to provide a flexible specification which will serve as the base format for all FT's. 

FT's minted to this specification will be able to be served by explorers, wallets and other applications, allowing those applications to display a minimum amount of information regardless of the 
use case of the FT and providing a standardized format for specialized token types.

## Motivation

Metadata is typically associated with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), for which metadata such as artwork is typically stored off-ledger to avoid typically relatively high on-ledger storage costs. 

HIP-10 normalizes a metadata model for NFTs on Hedera  where the HTS token points at a (possibly off-ledger) JSON file that itself carries information about the characteristics of the token and links to media.

As for NFTs, it may be useful to provide information about a fungible token beyond that which is stored on-ledger. This specification follows the HIP-10 model to allow a fungible HTS token to point to a (possibly off-ledger) JSON file carrying that additional information. The key differene is that this specification defines a JSON schema optimized for fungible tokens rather than NFTs. 

While this specification follows the HIP-10 model, the current reality is that mechanism by which a token points to a JSON metadata file is different for an NFT than an FT. NFTs can have a `metadata` field for this pointer, while FTs do not.Consequently, FTs must leverage the more generic `memo` field on the token. It is expected that, in the future, this incongruity will be resolved so that the model is symmetrical across token types on HTS.

## Rationale

Rationale for this design

- staying consistent with HIP-10 model for NFT metadata
- provide sufficient flexibility on which metadata fields are required and which optional
- acknowledge the current reality of the metadata field on HTS tokens being limited to NFTs 

## Specification

## Schema

The JSON metadata for a fungible token can include the following information

- Description 
- SVG logo (maybe multiple variations/formats beyond SVG)
- Website adddress
- Chat/discord address
- Whitepaper address

Below is the human-readable schema, presented to maximize clarity. 

```
{
    "name": "token Name - REQUIRED",
    "creator": "artist",
    "creatorDID": "the DID of the entity creating the token - OPTIONAL ",
    "description": "human readable description of the fungible token - RECOMMENDED",
    "logo": "cid or path to the token's logo file - RECOMMENDED",
    "type": "mime type - ie image/jpeg - CONDITIONALLY OPTIONAL "
}
```
### Required, Optional and Conditionally Optional fields:


### Field Specific Rationale

#### creator

A string for the creator, or for multiple creators to be attributed use comma separated values.

Eg. “John Doe” or “John Doe, Jill Doe”

#### creatorDID

This is an optional field to carry a decentralized identifier for the creator. This would allow a creator to subsequently lay claim to a creation even if the current ownership is different.

The DID resolves to a DID document with a public key, and the creator would prove ownership of the corresponding key with a signature.

For example, a Hedera DID looks like 'did:hedera:mainnet:7Prd74ry1Uct87nZqL3ny7aR7Cg46JamVbJgk8azVgUm;hedera:mainnet:fid=0.0.123'. The DID resolves to a JSON DID Document.

#### logo

Points to the uri of the logo file. 

#### type

Mime type of the logo file. See **[mime formatting]** section for more details.

“type” is required if “logo” is defined. 

### Formatting Notes

#### URI Formatting

URI’s shall follow the following format: protocol://resource_location

For resources that are on the world wide web, the standard http and https protocols are acceptable. Ie. http://www.example.org/image/file.jpg

For resources that are on IPFS, the protocol must be ipfs:// and the resource location must be the cid of the file. Ie. ipfs://bafkreibwci24bt2xtqi23g35gfx63wj555u77lwl2t55ajbfjqomgefxce

For resources that are on the hedera file service, the protocol is hedera://

A more complete list of URI’s can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_URI_schemes

### Mime Formatting

Mime formatting shall follow the following format: type/subtype

As a rule, mime types are all lower case. However apps should be programmed to accept any case for robustness.

A list of common mime types can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types

Note that mime types for directories are not uniformly defined. Some IPFS CIDs point to directories rather than files, so this type is useful. This standard shall define it using the format: text/directory 

## Reference Implementation

#### Example Schema

This is an example of a basic metadata as described by this schema. Format “none” is used to indicate that this metadata does not adhere to any specific sub-schema. Note that all the fields in properties are arbitrary.
```
{
    "name": "Example NFT",
    “creator”: “John Doe”
    "description": "This is an example NFT metadata",
    "image": "ipfs://bafkreibwci24bt2xtqi23g35gfx63wj555u77lwl2t55ajbfjqomgefxce",
    "type": “image/png”,
    "format": “none”,
    “properties”: {
        “license”: “MIT-0”,
        “collection”: “Generic Collection Name”,
        “website”: “www.johndoe.com”
    }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This HIP is entirely opt-in, and does not break any existing functionality. It simply provides standards to facilitate integratons for the display of metadata for HTS tokens.

## Security Implications

Discuss mutability?

## How to Teach This

HTS implementations use this standard to provide additional metadata for their fungible tokens. 

Wallet and token explorer implementations interrogate HTS tokens using this standard to display additional metadata for fungible tokens.

Note that the referenced URI must fit within the token memo size restrictions.

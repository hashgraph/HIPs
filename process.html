<p> Process HIPs describe processes surrounding Hedera, or propose changes to processes. Process HIPs are like
    Standards Track HIPs but apply to areas other than the node and ecosystem software codebases. They may propose an
    implementation, but not to Hedera's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational HIPs,
    they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures,
    guidelines, and changes to the decision-making process. Any meta-HIP is also considered a Process HIP.</p>

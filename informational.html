<p>An Informational HIP describes a Hedera design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Hedera community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational HIPs do not necessarily represent a Hedera community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational HIPs or follow their direction.</p>
